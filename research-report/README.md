# CodeAssist "Living Paper"

## Statement of Purpose

In this subdirectory you will find a PDF file containing the "Day 0" research report for CodeAssist. This report is not a standard academic paper, and serves to lay the groundwork for our commitment to maintaining a "living paper" for the CodeAssist project; a research report that will get periodically updated with results, insights, etc. after each big update made to the CodeAssist app.

We are taking a unique approach to this research--an approach anchored in transparency. We will continue to build and iterate on the project completely in the open because we believe these principles must be entrenched in AI development so that we may all flourish, and not just a select few big companies. By breaking down silos and building together we can accelerate research progress without compromising on transparency, safety, and real-world utility of AI systems.

There are countless ways to contribute to CodeAssist, but here are three concrete routes:
- If you are less technical, you can help us understand what users want and what actually improves assistants simply by using the app and providing feedback--if you do not know how to code, join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/gensyn) and our wonderful community will help you get started!
- If you have experience in software development or contributing to open-source projects, you can help improve the app by contributing on [GitHub](https://github.com/gensyn-ai/codeassist)! The project is sprawling and has numerous features, improvements, etc. that will always need more eyes and hands on them.
- If you are an experienced researcher with relevant expertise, you are welcome to reach out and we can talk about possible collaborations! There are more open questions than hours in the day, so these sorts of collaborations will be essential as we make progress.

For more information on how to run the CodeAssist app you can find thorough documentation in the README on GitHub or directly in Gensyn's [Docs](https://docs.gensyn.ai/testnet/codeassist).

## Summary of Contributions
- We formalize *tool‑mediation games* (TMGs) and show they are a special case of assistance games. 
- We present a pair‑programming TMG with editor‑native states and actions.
- We release *CodeAssist*, a working app that instantiates the pair-programming TMG.

## Priorities For Next Update
- Upon release on 11/05/25 we will begin analyzing preliminary metrics on assistant performance with the baseline policy architecture and supervised PPO-only training.
- Gather user feedback, fix bugs which may affect metrics in unintended ways, and stabilize the UI/UX needed to embark on roadmap highlighted in the report.
